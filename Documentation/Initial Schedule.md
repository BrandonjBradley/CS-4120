Note: This is not actually filled in. So fill in how you think the weeks are best laid out. I started with week 2 since that is next week (Feb. 1 - 7) based on what was said in class. 

Note2: I think having a prototype of at least the GUI by week 4 or 5 would be a good idea. Maybe a working prototype by the end of week 7 so we have a week to tweak any minor things.
